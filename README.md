# 🧠 KG-Augmented-RAG-papers-digest



> 💎***Knowledge Meets Retrieval Augmented Generation***: 
>
> - Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) can only process documents in natural language form with semantic similarity, which lacks the understanding and use of linguistic logic. 
> - The structured information of Knowledge Graph (KG) can compensate for this shortcoming. 
>
> 🔍 ***Focus***: 
>
> - Simplifying the motivations and ideas of papers that analyze how KG empowers RAG systems with accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency.
> - Building up the system of research ideas from different angles.
